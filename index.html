    <h3>Notes</h3>
    This project was directly inspired by Justin Nordine's (<a href="https://twitter.com/jnordine">@jnordine</a>) work on the <a href="http://osintframework.com/">OSINT Framework</a> & by Jason Haddix's (<a href="https://twitter.com/Jhaddix">@jhaddix</a>) work on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1nNPiH_Go">Bug Hunter's Methodology v3</a>.<br><br>
    We wanted to create a public and free resource for current and aspiring Penetration Testers & Bug Hunter's in the community. We have both recieved a lot of help from the information made available to us by the community while we were both pursuing our OSCP certifications and had always wanted a consolidated respository of reference information we could have utilized during our course work as well as during our daily lives as Penetration Testers and Bug Hunters.<br>
